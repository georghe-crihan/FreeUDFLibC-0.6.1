Introduction

<P>
   FreeUDFLib is a free UDF library for use with InterBase databases.
It is written in Delphi, and all source code is provided. Just because
it is free, however, does not mean that it is public domain. If you have
questions regarding your rights, please see *note Licensing::.

InterBase corporation
---------------------


<P>
   InterBase (http://www.interbase.com) corporation has provided their
support by providing a home for both FreeUDFLib and FreeUDFLib (*note

<P>
   Obviously, without InterBase, FreeUDFLib would be virtually
meaningless, so a special thanks goes to all at InterBase, with a
strong vote of support to _please_ continue the outstanding work!

<P>
   Since FreeUDFLib is free, it is important to give developers a sense
of what kind of support they can expect. Although there are no
guarantees of _any kind_, I want to give developers reasonable
assurances of what they can, in general, expect from me.


<P>
   I believe that there are four basic levels of support developers
require:


<P>
  1. Prompt bug resolution.


<P>
  2. Thorough documentation.


<P>
  3. Wish lists.


<P>
  4. Standard help-desk style support. (How do I do ...? When should I
     do ... ?)

<P>
Bugs
----


<P>
   FreeUDFLib is intended to be used in production environments! To
that end, a demonstrated bug _will be fixed_ as promptly as possible.


<P>
   Because FreeUDFLib is completely free, developers also have access
to the source code. If a bug is fixed, send it to me, and I will
incorporate it in future "official releases" of the product.


<P>
   If a bug cannot be replicated, I will have a difficult time finding
it, so I can't guarantee resolution of these so-called phantom bugs,
but I will do my best to resolve them.


<P>
   If you provide me with a bug fix, your name will be included in the
acknowledgements section of this manual. Bug reports should be submitted
as e-mail messages _only_.


<P>

<P>
Documentation
-------------


<P>
   The policy on resolving source code bugs also stands for correcting
and maintaining good documentation. Please send me any and all
corrections and/or enhancements to the documentation.  _Every product
needs thorough and complete documentation_. Even though this product is
free, I have a desire to see it used in all environments. I can't
expect a developer to use it if there is no documentation.


<P>
   I can't guarantee that I will respond to you, only that your comments
will be heard and possibly included in future releases.


<P>

File: FreeUDFLib.info,  Node: Wish lists,  Next: Help desk,  Prev: Documentation,  Up: Technical support


<P>
Wish lists
----------


<P>
   Users can feel free to provide me with wish list requests and/or
FreeUDFLib enhancements.


<P>
   If you send me a wish list request, you will _not_ receive a
response from me, but you can be assured that your request will be
considered for future releases.


<P>
   If you send me an enhancement or extension to FreeUDFLib that you
would like included in the distribution, I will consider it and respond
accordingly. Keep in mind, however, that FreeUDFLib and _all_ source
code is free. Do not even think about asking to distribute proprietary
products with FreeUDFLib.


<P>
   If I distribute product enhancements written by others than myself,
their names will be included in the acknowledgements section of this
manual, and their source code will be acknowledged appropriately.

<P>
Help desk
---------


<P>
   I _don't_ do help desk support, at least not in general. You can
feel free to e-mail me with questions, but it is more likely than not
that you will not receive a response from me.


<P>
   Help desk style questions should be directed to an appropriate
Internet support group. The mailing list &#60;INTERBASE@dx100.mers.com&#62;, for
example, provides excellent support for InterBase related questions.


<P>
   If you absolutely require my assistance for some issue, I can provide
services for standard consulting rates.

<P>
About the documentation
=======================


<P>
   I have used a product called _texinfo_ to produce all documentation
for FreeUDFLib.


<P>
   From a single source file, I can produce a formatted manual, ready
for print-out (using _tex_), I can produce html, ready for viewing in a
browser, and I can produce rich-text for the production of a help file.


<P>
   I don't see the need for producing a help file, so I haven't included
one... just the original _texinfo_ documentation, a ready-produced
Acrobat file, and a single HTML manual.


<P>
   If the reader wishes to find more information on using _texinfo_
with Windows, search the internet for "GNU tex texinfo Windows". (O
yeah, _texinfo_ is free, protected under the GNU Public License)

<P>
8/6/98
======


<P>
   By default, FreeUDFLib uses thread-local variables to return strings
and dates to InterBase. There has been some speculation that
thread-local variables don't work as well as they should, although I
haven't been able to verify the speculation, (nor has InterBase, for
that matter).


<P>
   However, FreeUDFLib can now be built to use dynamic memory allocation
(with free_it) as opposed to thread-locals. In `udf_glob.pas', just
uncomment the conditional define called FREE_IT.


<P>
     {$FREE_IT}


<P>
   This allows you to declare all string and date UDFs with the free_it
convention.


<P>
   New stuff:


<P>
  1. New function: GenerateSndxIndex(sz: String);
     You can guess what this function does... It generates the soundex
     index as described on InterBase's web site.


<P>
  2. New function: LineWrap. It wraps a string and returns a given
     line. See its definition below.


<P>
   Several functions were removed which did not work, and so were
cluttering up the source.

<P>
3/13/98
=======


<P>
   Thread-safety has been pretty rigorously tested. Users should not
have any problems with FreeUDFLib.


<P>
   New functions:
  1. `EvaluateExpression': evalute a textual expression with support for
     symbols and string, date and numeric literals.

<P>
Installation
************


<P>
   After unzipping `FreeUDFLib.zip', copy `FreeUDFLib' to the InterBase
bin directory, most probably


<P>
     c:\Program Files\InterBase Corp\InterBase\Bin
     
     - or -
     
     c:\Program Files\Borland\IntrBase\Bin


<P>
   Whenever you require the use of FreeUDFLib in an InterBase database,
run the `ext_funcs.sql' SQL script against the database.

Obsolete functions
==================


<P>
   The below functions are now considered _obsolete_. At some point in
future releases of FreeUDFLib, they will no longer exist.


<P>
   When a developer has a convincing argument as to _why_ FreeUDFLib
should continue to include the function, please let me know, and I will
consider your argument.


<P>
  1. `UserMaintenance' is _not_ a terribly useful function for adding
     and deleting users. It asks IB to start the gsec procedure on the
     server to add users, etc... Instead, the `IBPassword' function can
     be used with a direct connection to ISC4.GDB for adding, deleting
     and modifying users.

String routines
---------------


<P>
 - Function: PChar Character (var NUMBER: Integer)
     Given the provided ordinal value, return the associated character.
          declare external function f_Character
            integer
            returns cstring(2)
            entry_point 'Character' module_name 'FreeUDFLib';


<P>
 - Function: PChar CRLF ()
     Return the carriage return/line feed string.
          declare external function f_CRLF
            returns cstring(3)
            entry_point 'CRLF' module_name 'FreeUDFLib';


<P>
 - Function: PChar FindNthWord (SZ: PChar; var I: Integer)
     A convenient way to find the Nth word in a string; however, if you
     are scanning an entire string to pick out each individual word, it
     is recommended that you use FindWord and FindWordIndex instead.


<P>
 - Function: PChar FindWord (SZ: PChar; var I: Integer)
     Given a starting position, return the first word starting at that
     position.
     NOTE: Strings passed to FindWord start at index 0.


<P>
 - Function: Integer FindWordIndex (SZ: PChar; var I: Integer)
     Given a starting position, return the index of the first word that
     starts on or after that position. This function helps to account
     for whitespace.
     NOTE: Strings passed to FindWordIndex start at index 0.


<P>
 - Function: PChar GenerateFormattedName (SZFORMATSTRING, SZNAMEPREFIX,
          SZFIRSTNAME, SZMIDDLEINITIAL, SZLASTNAME, SZNAMESUFFIX: PChar)
     Given a name prefix (SZNAMEPREFIX), a first name (SZFIRSTNAME), a
     middle initial (SZMIDDLEINITIAL), a last name (SZLASTNAME), and a
     name suffix (SZNAMESUFFIX), construct a formatted name based on
     the provided format string (SZFORMATSTRING).


<P>
     A format string is constructed as follows:


<P>
          Commands:
           \&#60;pretext&#62;\&#60;posttext&#62;\P  --&#62; name prefix
           \&#60;pretext&#62;\&#60;posttext&#62;\F  --&#62; first name
           \&#60;pretext&#62;\&#60;posttext&#62;\M  --&#62; middle initial
           \&#60;pretext&#62;\&#60;posttext&#62;\L  --&#62; last name
           \&#60;pretext&#62;\&#60;posttext&#62;\S  --&#62; name suffix
            - escape character; anything following an  will be printed as a literal
          
           --options (affect the entire string)--
           \\\A   --&#62; print only alpha's, i.e. strip string of anything but alpha's
           \\\9   --&#62; print only alpha's and numeric's, i.e. strip string of
                      everything but alpha's
           \\\U   --&#62; uppercase string


<P>
     All other strings are just printed as-is.


<P>
     You use "pretext" and "posttext" values when the text preceding or
     succeeding a field depends on the presence of a value in the field.
     An example:


<P>
            format string = '\\ \P\\ \F\\. \M\\\L\, \\S'
          
            1. Name Prefix = Mr.
               First name = John
               Middle initial = M
               Last name = Smith
               Name suffix = III
                 GenerateFormattedName yields Mr. John M. Smith, III
            2. Same as (1), but
               Name prefix is blank
               Middle initial is blank
               Name suffix is blank
                 GenerateFormattedName yields John Smith
            3. Same as (1), but
               Name prefix is blank
               Name suffix is blank
                 GenerateFormattedName yields John M. Smith


<P>
 - Function: PChar GenerateSndxIndex (SZ: PChar)
     Given a string SZ, compute its _soundex_ value. The documentation
     for this implementation of soundex can be found at InterBase
     (http://www.interbase.com/tech/docs/soundex1.html)'s web site.


<P>
 - Function: PChar Left (SZ: PChar; var NUMBER: Integer)
     Return the NUMBER leftmost characters of SZ.


<P>
 - Function: PChar LineWrap (SZ: PChar; var START, COLWIDTH: Integer)
     Given a starting point (START) in a string, and a column width,
     COLWIDTH, return the portion of SZ, starting at START that fits in
     COLWIDTH character spaces.
     NOTE: Strings passed to LineWrap start at index 0.


<P>
 - Function: PChar lrTrim (SZ: PChar)
     Trim whitespace on both sides of SZ. In other words, trim all
     leading and trailing whitespace.


<P>
 - Function: PChar lTrim (SZ: PChar)
     Trim whitespace on the left side of SZ. In other words, trim all
     leading whitespace.


<P>
 - Function: PChar Mid (SZ: PChar; var Start, NUMBER: Integer)
     Return NUMBER characters from SZ, starting at START position.
     NOTE: Strings passed to Mid start at index 0.


<P>
 - Function: PChar PadLeft (SZ, SZPADSTRING: PChar; var LEN: Integer)

Miscellaneous routines
----------------------


<P>
 - Function: CloseDebuggerOutput: Integer
     Used in conjunction with `SetDebuggerOutput', and `Debug'.  This
     function closes whatever the currently set output handle is.


<P>
 - Function: Integer Debug (SZDEBUGGEROUTPUT: PChar)
     Used in conjunction with `SetDebuggerOutput' and
     `CloseDebuggerOutput'. This function writes a string to the
     currently set debugger handle.


<P>
 - Function: Integer EvaluateCycleExpression (SZCYCLEEXPRESSION: PChar;
          var EXPRSTART: Integer; OLDDATE, NEWDATE: PISC_QUAD; var
          AMOUNT: Double)
     A cycle expression is a prefix notation expression evaluator that
     takes as input a possible OLDDATE, NEWDATE and dollar AMOUNT.


<P>
     A billing expression is


<P>
        * The question, 'Given X bill cycle (in months), is AGE mod X
          0?'
          This question is expressed simply by using a valid integer.
          For example, in semi-pseudo code


<P>
                 EvaluateCycleExpression('3', 0, '1/1/98', '4/1/98', 0) = 1;
                 EvaluateCycleExpression('3', 0, '1/1/98', '3/1/98', 0) = 0;


<P>
        * The question, 'Is the age in months of the file &#62;= X?'
          This question is expressed simply by typing a '&#62;', followed
          by a valid integer. For example, in semi-pseudo code:


<P>
                 EvaluateCycleExpression('&#62;6', 0, '1/1/98', '8/1/98', 0) = 1;
                 EvaluateCycleExpression('3', 0, '1/1/98', '3/1/98', 0) = 0;


<P>
        * The question, 'Is the dollar value &#62;= X?'
          This question is expressed simply by typing a '$', followed
          by a valid float. For example, in semi-pseudo code:


<P>
                 EvaluateCycleExpression('$1000', 0, '1/1/98', '8/1/98', 3000) = 1;
                 EvaluateCycleExpression('$1000', 0, '1/1/98', '3/1/98', 0) = 0;


<P>
        * A valid expression is:


<P>
                 OR &#60;valid expression&#62; &#60;valid expression&#62;


<P>
          This allows you to "or" two expressions together.


<P>
        * A valid expression is:


<P>
                 AND &#60;valid expression&#62; &#60;valid expression&#62;


<P>
          This allows you to "and" two expressions together.


<P>
        *        NOT &#60;valid expression&#62;


<P>
          This allows you to negate the result of an expression.


<P>
 - Function: PChar EvaluateExpression(SZEXPR, SZSYMBOLS: PChar)
     `EvaluteExpression' is a fully featured expression evaluator. It
     allows you to use typical parenthesized syntax to compare values of
     symbols passed in a symbol list with constants.


<P>
     The full syntaxes of an expression and of a symbol list are listed
     in `ExprParser.y', and `Symbols.l', respectively.


<P>
     This simple example of an expression should be enough to get you
     started, though:


<P>
            EvaluateExpression(
              '(MyDate={1/1/98}) and (HelloWorld='hello') and (A=B + 9)'
              'MyDate={1/1/98} HelloWorld='hello' A=18 B=9') = 1


<P>
 - Function: PChar IBTempPath ()
     Return what InterBase currently thinks the temporary path is.


<P>
 - Function: Integer SetDebuggerOutput (SZOUTPUTFILE: PChar)
     Used in conjuction with `Debug' and `CloseDebuggerOutput'. This
     function sets the current output to a file, or to `STDOUT'. To set
     the debugger output to a file, just pass a file name in. The file
     name `STDOUT' is a special file name that tells
     `SetDebuggerOutput' to set the output to the standard output.


<P>
 - Function: Integer ValidateCycleExpression (SZCYCLEEXPRESSION: PChar;
          var EXPRSTART: Integer)
     Given a billing cycle-style expression as described in
     `EvaluateCycleExpression', determine if the expression is valid.
