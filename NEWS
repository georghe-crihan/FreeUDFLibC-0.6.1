		FreeUDFLib C explanatory note

	If You are curious about my motivations, please read ChangeLog. Aside
	from being a detailed log of the modifications to the library, it
	contains some technical information, that might be useful when porting/
	building the library. But, please, make sure to read and agree to the
	COPYING first!

	The library is now a superset of the DELPHI version (see
	doc/superset.txt for function names).

	Building:
	In most cases see INSTALL for information, however, if configure fails
	you need to do it manually.
	My platform is FreeBSD, so this paragraph is primarily applicable to
	it, but, hopefully, at least some things are true for other systems.
	  $ cp common/Makefile common/config.h .
          $ vi Makefile # if you need internal MD5 and/or other functions
	  $ vi config.h # You may Define Debug level, HaveStrlcpy, HaveMD5,
			# Syslog, etc.
	  $ make
	  $ make install
	NOTE: this is the only way to provide compatibility with old
	all-lowercase-underscore naming convention. As I strongly discourage
	falling back to old names, You are very much on your own here, and
	the method is GNU ld-specific. So, above, instead of make type the
	following (I assume You use sh)
	  $ SUBSTS=`awk 'BEGIN{FS="\n";RS="\t"};{gsub(FS," ");print}' common/oldnamesubst.ld` make
	Afterwards You may run tests (see below)
	
	Building under Win32:
	Get MSVC suit.
	>copy common\config.h.win config.h
	>copy common\Makefile.win Makefile
	>edit Makefile
	>edit config.h
	>make
	

	Testing:
	Tests are located in tests/ subdirectory. Edit connect.sql/create.sql
	as appropriate and run buildbase. Try to use filtertest as an output 
	filter.
	You might want to edit usertest/passw_test also. 
	WARNING: Buildbase drops the database.

	Debugging:
	I use my syslog to do this. It solves the prorblem of reentrancy
	as well as, being a standalone service (which means it runs in a
	separate process and is not vulnerable to InterBase/FreeUDFLib
	crashes) could even run on a different computer, with messages
	being directed there and processed.
	I added the following line to my /etc/syslog.conf:
		local1.info	/var/log/FreeUDFLib.log
	NOTE: if You already have some software, using local1 facility,
	      use an available user facility and change the config.h
	      accordingly.
	Then isssue an `echo >> /var/log/FreeUDFLib.log`.
	NOTE: As the logfile might contain some sensitive informations, make
	sure the proper permissions are set (I use mode 600).
	Do not forget to send SIGHUP to syslogd afterwards.
	
	Porting to other platforms:
	With other unices it should be easy (I hope).
