- Fix configure.in to automatically provide absent functions

- Provide crypt() for all platforms (notably Win32). I do not want
	to deal with export restrictions, laws, etc. If You need it
	under WIN32, get yourself a free WIN32 DES implementation. 
        (From WWW.OpenBSD.org, for instance).

- Provide automake 'make check' for tests?
